Services Package

This folder contains our business logic - the actual "work" our application does.

Think of services as different departments in a company:
- SentimentService: The psychology department that analyzes emotions in text
- KeywordService: The research department that finds important words
- ReadabilityService: The education department that checks how easy text is to read
- DocumentService: The filing department that stores and retrieves documents

Each service has one job and does it well (this is called "separation of concerns").
