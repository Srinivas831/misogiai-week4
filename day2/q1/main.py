"""
Document Analyzer MCP Server

This is the main entry point for our MCP server.
MCP (Model Context Protocol) allows AI assistants to use our document analysis tools.

Think of this as a waiter in a restaurant:
- AI assistant is the customer
- This MCP server is the waiter  
- Our analysis functions are the kitchen

The AI will ask our server to analyze documents, and we'll provide the results.
