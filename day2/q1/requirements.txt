# Document Analyzer MCP Server Requirements
# 
# Think of this like a shopping list for Python packages (libraries)
# Each package gives us special powers:

# MCP (Model Context Protocol) - Allows AI assistants to talk to our server
mcp==1.0.0

# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Libraries
# These help us understand and analyze text:
nltk==3.8.1          # Natural Language Toolkit - tokenization, stop words
textblob==0.17.1      # Simple sentiment analysis and text processing  
textstat==0.7.3       # Readability scoring (how easy text is to read)

# Optional: More advanced NLP (we might use this later)
# spacy==3.7.2        # Advanced NLP library

# Utility Libraries
python-dotenv==1.0.0  # For environment variables (settings)

# Development Tools
pytest==7.4.3        # For testing our code
black==23.12.0        # For making our code look nice and consistent
