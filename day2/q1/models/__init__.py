"""
Models Package

This folder contains our data models - think of these as blueprints or templates.

For example:
- Document model: defines what a document looks like (title, content, metadata)
- Analysis model: defines what an analysis result looks like (sentiment, keywords, etc.)

It's like having a form template that tells us what information we need to collect.
