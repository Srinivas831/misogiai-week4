Hi, I'm Srinivas and my teammate Gautam is here. So the product that we are building is Visual Tutor AI. So basically speaking about the problem, today learning something is very hard that too in tech field it's too hard to learn something like many people first approach is they go to YouTube and they search for things what to learn. So they find ending up and getting a lot of videos or and other stuff they it feels difficult for them to select the right one and second option is they go to Udemy to get a proper course and the problem in Udemy is no one to assist you then and there. Yeah you have a dedicated course for yourself but the problem is you don't have someone to teach you then and there sort out your problem. So this people face very much it's a very big problem for people who's trying to learn an upskill this not only waste time but also it kills motivation because they need to go to a GPT ask them and again clear the doubts again come to YouTube or Udemy whatever it is. So this is the base problem. So keeping this as a base problem the solution we are doing is personal AI tutor. So it's like a private teacher who teaches you stuff 24 by 7 everything and the main thing here is because everyone can do this because it's a GPT itself even we have Google AI to do a lot of things which can teach you like this. But the pain point we are trying to solve is it not only teaches through text or words like it just share the screen it shows the architecture it shows the visually and it writes syntaxes in a screen and it tries to keep on interacting with you like a teacher and solves it. So that's the main pain point we are trying to solve here and and up keeping this as the main point apart from this the user will get to interact properly through voice or text whatever. So other everything will be there. So I will tell how it works basically. So the thing is first when the user logs in or comes to our application we'll take his basic details like about his background what experience he has and what all he's he has studied till now and what all skills he has. So based on that we will customize the personal course for him this no one does because you take Udemy it is for it's not a personalized course it's for general. But here we are building a personalized course for someone who wants to learn through that way because we can see some people are fast some people are slow and learning they needed a dedicated approach to learn right. So that's the main thing we are trying to solve here. So GPT will customize the course for him and it will give what all he has to learn in a structured format and then it will start teaching that's when the main action begins. So so the MVP what we are trying to do is in the first version build this chat or voice interface and and teaching visually will be our basic thing which we will try to do in this MVP and all the other things like fetching basic details of the user and stuff around it. So tech stack speaking about the tech stack so it will be react plus white and frontend and backend still we haven't yet discussed but it will be like Node.js or express. So just wanted to show these things and in terms of speaking about the long term currently we are just keeping it for the tech because we have to give prompts because that will be a big challenge. So currently to keep it in a shell we are doing it only for tech tech related though. So here the user can only learn related to tech and if it's like a scalable we'll do it for all the subject like all the other subjects as well. So yes this is what we both wanted to present here today and thanks for giving this such an opportunity to showcase this idea what we have. Yes. Thank you. Yes.
